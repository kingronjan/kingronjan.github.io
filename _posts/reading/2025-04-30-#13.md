### Python



##### [Python: range is not an iterator](https://treyhunner.com/2018/02/python-range-is-not-an-iterator/)

`range` is not an iterator, `range` support index, keep state. for example, for iterator, once move forward, can not back only more:

```python
>>> my_iterator = iter([1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> list(zip(my_iterator, my_iterator))
[(1, 2), (3, 4)]
```

but for range:

```python
>>> numbers = range(1, 5)
>>> list(zip(numbers, numbers))
[(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)]
```
